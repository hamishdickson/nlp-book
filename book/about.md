Hi and welcome to Introduction to Natural Language Processing!

Over the course of this book, my aim is to introduce nlp to you. It has been written while learning nlp myself and has started out as an expansion to the online book [Natural Language Processing for the Working Programmer](http://nlpwp.org/book/index.xhtml).

Nlpwp is good, but is incomplete and a bit out of date (it was written in 2010) - my aim here is to provide something up to date and largely self-contained.

This book is a work in progress, meaning right now you may find material that is:

- wrong ([if so, let me know](https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book/issues))
- out of date ([send me a pull request](https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book/pulls))
- considered bad practice ([let me know](https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book/issues))
- lots of other things (you get the idea)

but hey, this book is on github, so hopefully someone will hit me up with the right thing!

Like have just said, this is an expansion of the book written by DaniÃ«l de Kok and Harm Brouwer. My main adaptions are simply to carry on where they left off, but the core of this book can be found in their work [http://nlpwp.org/book/index.xhtml](http://nlpwp.org/book/index.xhtml).

I will take no offence if you go right to their book and ignore my update.

The whole of this book can be found [on my github page](https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book) and has been written under the MIT licence, which basically means you can do with it what you will.

With all that in mind, feel free to contact me if you have any questions/comments (/thanks??) hamish.dickson@gmail.com
