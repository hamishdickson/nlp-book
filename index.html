        <h2>0. About</h2>

        <p>Hi and welcome to Introduction to Natural Language Processing!</p>

        <p>Over the course of this book, my aim is to introduce nlp to you. It has been written while learning nlp
            myself and has started out as an expansion to the online book <a href="http://nlpwp.org/book/index.xhtml"
                                                             target="_blank">Natural Language Processing for the Working Programmer</a> (nlpwp).

            Nlpwp is good, but is incomplete and a bit out of date (it was written in 2010) - my aim is to provide
            something up to date and largely self-contained.</p>

        <p>This book is a work in progress, meaning right now you may find material that is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>wrong (<a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book/issues" target="_blank">if so, let me
                know</a>)
            </li>
            <li>out of date (<a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book/pulls" target="_blank">send me a pull
                request</a>)
            </li>
            <li>considered bad practice (<a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book/issues" target="_blank">let me
                know</a>)
            </li>
            <li>lots of other things (you get the idea)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>but hey, this book is on github, so hopefully someone will hit me up with the right thing!</p>

        <h3>0.1 Thanks</h3>
        <p>Like have just said, this is an expansion of the book written by Daniël de Kok and Harm Brouwer.
            My main adaptions are to simply add more detail, more examples and a nice skin (circa
            2015),
            but the core of this book can be found in their work <a href="http://nlpwp.org/book/index.xhtml"
                                                                    target="_blank">http://nlpwp.org/book/index.xhtml</a>.
            I will take no offence if you go right to their book and ignore my update.
        </p>

        <p>The whole of this book can be found <a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book" target="_blank">on my github
            page</a> and has been written under the MIT licence, which basically means you can do with it what you will.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Welcome</h3>

        <p>The Internet and the World Wide Web have changed mankind, forever. It is to early too tell, but their impact
            may
            be as great as the combustion engine or the introduction of electric devices. The Internet gave universal
            access
            to information, not just information that broadcasters or newspapers thought that was important, but
            information
            that interests the 'websurfer'. However the Internet is not a one-way street, every Internet user is also a
            producer: people make websites, maintain blogs, post tweets, and socialize via social networks.</p>

        <p>Since a substantial part of the world has Internet access, and every user is also a producer, there is an
            enormous amount of information available. Some of it is of peer-reviewed and of a high quality, most of it
            is
            unchecked and biased. Still, every single piece of information can contain valuable information. For
            instance,
            as a vacuum cleaner producer, you might think that social media are not so interesting. However, the
            contrary is
            true: between billions of messages there may be hundreds expressing sentiment about your product. Such
            messages
            can answer questions about how your brand is conceived, what problems people commonly have with your
            product,
            etc.</p>

        <p>Obviously, it is out of anyone's reach to manually analyze a significant portion of the information that is
            available on the Internet. The amount is just too overwhelming. Classic data analysis tools may not suffice
            either, most of the information is seemingly unstructured, and consist of blobs of natural language
            sentences.
            However, language is also structure. It is just not the kind of structure that computers can normally deal
            with.
            Computers deal with neat XML files, fragments of JSON, or comma separated values. No, it is the structure
            that
            we humans use to convey and transfer meaning. This book is about that type of information. We will go into
            many
            of the techniques that so-called computational linguists use to analyze the structure of human language, and
            transform it into a form that computers work with.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Who is this book for?</h3>
        <p>Anyone who has a few years programming with a language like C++, java, python, php, ruby - something rich,
        but not purely functional. While this book isn't about Haskell or Functional Programming, we will go through
        the concepts as required and it will hopefully be pretty much self contained.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>1.3 Help! I'm stuck!</h3>
        <p>If you're stuck on any of the material in this book, then Google really is your friend - if that doesn't work
        then please get in touch - I'm easy enough to contact and if I can help I will (then probably update the book
        to help others!)</p>

        <h3>1.2 What is natural language processing?</h3>

        <p>Well, right from wikipedia: "Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial
            intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human
            (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of human–computer interaction. Many challenges in
            NLP involve natural language understanding, that is, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or
            natural language input, and others involve natural language generation."</p>

        <h2>2. Haskell</h2>

        <h3>2.1 What's a Haskell?</h3>

        <p>Haskell is a static, pure, lazy, functional language. Gee, that sounds an awful lot like buzzword lingo! That
            may well be, but these properties make Haskell a very effective language, and sometimes a bit odd. These
            properties are also opposite to most mainstream languages. For instance, Java is static, impure, eager, and
            not functional, Ruby is dynamic, impure, eager, and only functional at times. While it is hard to give an
            accurate definition of every characteristic, we will try anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            Functional: Haskell puts an emphasis on functions and treats computation as the evaluation of functions.
            This in contrast to so-called imperative languages, that specify an order of instructions. As such, Haskell
            functions very often resemble mathematical functions closely. Being functional also has practical
            implications. For instance, iteration is accomplished by means of recursion, and functions are also values
            and can be passed to other functions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pure: Haskell is a pure language, in that functions do not have side-effects. This means that existing
            values cannot be changed, since changing data would be a side-effect of a function. It also guarantees that
            the evaluation of a function will always result in the same value given the same function arguments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lazy: As a lazy language, Haskell only evaluates expressions when needed. Say you just implemented a
            function that gives a list of all prime numbers. In a strict language, the function that makes the list will
            never terminate (since there are always more prime numbers). Haskell, on the contrary, will only evaluate
            this function when and as much as necessary. As long as you take a finite number of primes from the list,
            the program will happily terminate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Static: Haskell programs are compiled before they can run. This means that the Haskell compiler will catch
            many errors for you at compile-time, rather than finding them when your program is used in production.
            Additionally, Haskell does type-inference. This means that the Haskell compiler can find out the types of
            values most of the times, and you do not need to type-annotate every value.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have prior programming experience in an imperative or eager language, Haskell can feel a bit odd in
            the beginning. Don't worry, you will feel warm and fuzzy eventually!
        </p>

        <p>
            You may ask why we chose Haskell as the main programming language for this book, rather than a more
            mainstream language. During our own experiences developing natural language processing tools, we noticed
            that very many natural language processing tasks are relatively straightforward data transformations.
            Haskell is a language that is exceptionally good at data transformations. First of all, because it has
            higher order functions (functions that take functions as an argument) that traverse lists, sets, mappings,
            etc. Second, Haskell makes it easy to construct more complex transformations out of simple transformations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although this book does not provide a full introduction to the Haskell programming language, we try to cover
            Haskell concepts extensively when required. If you require more background on certain concepts, we recommend
            you to consult the free book <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn Haskell for Great Good!</a></p>

        <h3>2.1 Haskell isn't your typical language</h3>
        <p>If you've come from java, python or any other imperative language then you may have heard about some of
        Haskell's features.. or you may not have, so let's talk a bit about them.</p>

        <p>More detail here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>2.2 Getting up and running</h3>

        <p>To work with this book, you need the Haskell Platform and a text editor. The Haskell Platform is available
            for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux at: <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/" target="_blank">http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/</a>.
            Download the package for your
            platform, and install it.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you do not use one of these platforms, not all is lost. First of all, you should download the ghc Haskell
            compiler. If you operating system provides a ports system or package manager, use it to locate and install a
            ghc package. If your operating system does not provide a port or package for ghc, you can still try to
            download a binary distribution from the GHC website. Once you have installed and set up ghc, install the
            packages of the Haskell Platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the text editor, pick any editor you find comfortable, as long as it saves files as plain text.
            Programming Haskell becomes more comfortable if you have an editor with syntax highlighting and interpreter
            integration. Your authors prefer the Emacs editor with haskell-mode. haskell-mode provides good support for
            highlighting, and Haskell code formatting. Besides that, Emacs allows you to run the ghci Haskell
            interpreter within the editor.
        </p>

        <h4>2.2.1 Editors</h4>

        <p>
            If you don't like emacs (weirdo) and have no idea what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war"
                                                                      target="_blank">the editor wars</a>
            are, then you probably want to use something like <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">atom</a> or <a
                href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">sublime text</a>. Both are excellent.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>2.3 Baby's first Haskell</h3>

        <p>You will probably want to get acquainted with the ghci Haskell interpreter. It allows you to try Haskell
            expressions and get immediate feedback.</p>

        <p>On OS X or Linux systems, type ghci -XNoMonomorphismRestriction in a terminal
            to launch the interpreter. You will be greeted with a prompt that resembles the following:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/hamishdickson/e357d715f911d6da3da6.js"></script>

        <p>On Windows, choose Start -> All Programs -> Haskell Platform -> WinGHCi. The first time, you should set the
            NoMonomorphismRestriction option that is required for some examples. Do this by going to the following item:
            File > Options > GHCi Startup. Then append -XNoMonomorphismRestriction in the field (make sure that there is
            a space before this addition). Click OK, and restart WinGHCi.</p>
