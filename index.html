        <p>Hi and welcome to Introduction to Natural Language Processing!</p>

        <p>I am, right now learning nlp. That means I can't promise that everything in here is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>correct (<a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book/issues" target="_blank">if so, let me know</a>)</li>
            <li>up to date (<a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book/pulls" target="_blank">send me a pull request</a>)</li>
            <li>good practice (<a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book/issues" target="_blank">let me know</a>)</li>
            <li>lots of other things (you get the idea)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>but hey, this book is on github, so hopefully someone will hit me up with the right thing!</p>

        <p>I have taken a book written by Daniël de Kok and Harm Brouwer and adapted it as
        I've gone along. My main adaptions are to simply add more detail, more examples and a nice skin (circa 2015),
            but the core of this book can be found in their work <a href="http://nlpwp.org/book/index.xhtml" target="_blank">http://nlpwp.org/book/index.xhtml</a></p>

        <p>This whole book can be found <a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson/nlp-book" target="_blank">on my github page</a>.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Welcome</h3>

        <p>The Internet and the World Wide Web have changed mankind, forever. It is to early too tell, but their impact
            may
            be as great as the combustion engine or the introduction of electric devices. The Internet gave universal
            access
            to information, not just information that broadcasters or newspapers thought that was important, but
            information
            that interests the 'websurfer'. However the Internet is not a one-way street, every Internet user is also a
            producer: people make websites, maintain blogs, post tweets, and socialize via social networks.</p>

        <p>Since a substantial part of the world has Internet access, and every user is also a producer, there is an
            enormous amount of information available. Some of it is of peer-reviewed and of a high quality, most of it
            is
            unchecked and biased. Still, every single piece of information can contain valuable information. For
            instance,
            as a vacuum cleaner producer, you might think that social media are not so interesting. However, the
            contrary is
            true: between billions of messages there may be hundreds expressing sentiment about your product. Such
            messages
            can answer questions about how your brand is conceived, what problems people commonly have with your
            product,
            etc.</p>

        <p>Obviously, it is out of anyone's reach to manually analyze a significant portion of the information that is
            available on the Internet. The amount is just too overwhelming. Classic data analysis tools may not suffice
            either, most of the information is seemingly unstructured, and consist of blobs of natural language
            sentences.
            However, language is also structure. It is just not the kind of structure that computers can normally deal
            with.
            Computers deal with neat XML files, fragments of JSON, or comma separated values. No, it is the structure
            that
            we humans use to convey and transfer meaning. This book is about that type of information. We will go into
            many
            of the techniques that so-called computational linguists use to analyze the structure of human language, and
            transform it into a form that computers work with.</p>

        <h2>1.2 What is natural language processing?</h2>

        <p>Well, right from wikipedia: "Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial
            intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human
            (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of human–computer interaction. Many challenges in
            NLP involve natural language understanding, that is, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or
            natural language input, and others involve natural language generation."</p>

        <h2>1.2 What is natural language processing?</h2>

        <p>Haskell is a static, pure, lazy, functional language. Gee, that sounds an awful lot like buzzword lingo! That
            may well be, but these properties make Haskell a very effective language, and sometimes a bit odd. These
            properties are also opposite to most mainstream languages. For instance, Java is static, impure, eager, and
            not functional, Ruby is dynamic, impure, eager, and only functional at times. While it is hard to give an
            accurate definition of every characteristic, we will try anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            Functional: Haskell puts an emphasis on functions and treats computation as the evaluation of functions.
            This in contrast to so-called imperative languages, that specify an order of instructions. As such, Haskell
            functions very often resemble mathematical functions closely. Being functional also has practical
            implications. For instance, iteration is accomplished by means of recursion, and functions are also values
            and can be passed to other functions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pure: Haskell is a pure language, in that functions do not have side-effects. This means that existing
            values cannot be changed, since changing data would be a side-effect of a function. It also guarantees that
            the evaluation of a function will always result in the same value given the same function arguments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lazy: As a lazy language, Haskell only evaluates expressions when needed. Say you just implemented a
            function that gives a list of all prime numbers. In a strict language, the function that makes the list will
            never terminate (since there are always more prime numbers). Haskell, on the contrary, will only evaluate
            this function when and as much as necessary. As long as you take a finite number of primes from the list,
            the program will happily terminate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Static: Haskell programs are compiled before they can run. This means that the Haskell compiler will catch
            many errors for you at compile-time, rather than finding them when your program is used in production.
            Additionally, Haskell does type-inference. This means that the Haskell compiler can find out the types of
            values most of the times, and you do not need to type-annotate every value.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have prior programming experience in an imperative or eager language, Haskell can feel a bit odd in
            the beginning. Don't worry, you will feel warm and fuzzy eventually!
        </p>

        <p>
            You may ask why we chose Haskell as the main programming language for this book, rather than a more
            mainstream language. During our own experiences developing natural language processing tools, we noticed
            that very many natural language processing tasks are relatively straightforward data transformations.
            Haskell is a language that is exceptionally good at data transformations. First of all, because it has
            higher order functions (functions that take functions as an argument) that traverse lists, sets, mappings,
            etc. Second, Haskell makes it easy to construct more complex transformations out of simple transformations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although this book does not provide a full introduction to the Haskell programming language, we try to cover
            Haskell concepts extensively when required. If you require more background on certain concepts, we recommend
            you to consult the book Learn Haskell for Great Good!</p>
